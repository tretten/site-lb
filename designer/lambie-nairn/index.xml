Its headquarters are in London, with a National HQ in Leeds and creative hubs in Glasgow and Bristol. It began its transmission on 2 November 1982, the day after Welsh language broadcaster S4C&amp;rsquo;s launch. The channel was established to provide a fourth television service in the United Kingdom; at the time the only other channels were the licence-funded BBC 1 and BBC 2, and a single commercial broadcasting network ITV.</description></item></channel></rss>
