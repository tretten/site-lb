It was founded in 1916, receiving its royal charter in 1928. Queen Elizabeth II is the patron. The majority of members are registered nurses; however student nurses and healthcare assistants are also members. There is also a category of membership, at a reduced cost, for retired people. The RCN describes its mission as representing nurses and nursing, promoting excellence in practice and shaping health policies.</description></item></channel></rss>
