Its forerunner, the National Parks Commission, was established in 1949 by the National Parks and Access to the countryside Act 1949 to co-ordinate government activity in relation to National Parks. This body became the countryside Commission for England and Wales in 1968, when its duties were expanded to cover the countryside as a whole in England and Wales.</description></item></channel></rss>
